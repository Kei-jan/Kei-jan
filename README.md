Iâ€™m currently a graduate student learning medical image analysis with deep learning. 

My clinical tasks are mainly focused on cross-modal cardiac image analysis and segmentation. The technical solutions I used to accomplish these tasks mainly used domain generalization and causal representation.

During undergraduate studies, I mainly learned human motion analysis and pose estimation besides basic courses.

I am also interested in brain-computer interface and multi-modal generation.
